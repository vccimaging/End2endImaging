# DeepLens

**Differentiable optical lens simulator for end-to-end camera system design.**

DeepLens models the full imaging pipeline — optics, sensor, and image processing — in a fully differentiable framework built on PyTorch. This enables gradient-based optimization of camera systems from lens surfaces all the way through neural image reconstruction.

## Key Features

- **Differentiable ray tracing** through multi-element lens systems with automatic differentiation
- **Multiple lens models**: geometric (`GeoLens`), hybrid refractive-diffractive (`HybridLens`), pure diffractive (`DiffractiveLens`), neural surrogate (`PSFNetLens`), and thin-lens (`ParaxialLens`)
- **End-to-end optimization** of optics + sensor + reconstruction network jointly
- **Physically-based sensor simulation** with Bayer pattern, noise model, and full ISP pipeline
- **Standard lens file I/O**: read/write Zemax `.zmx`, Code V `.seq`, and JSON formats

## Quick Install
